## **Section 1**-- Basic Excel Analysis
iPhone Sales Analysis – India
Overview

This analysis explores iPhone sales patterns in India across months, days, states, platforms, and models. The findings reveal how timing, geography, and platform strategies strongly shape Apple’s market performance.

Key Insights
📅 Monthly Trends

September is the peak month, with nearly 3,000 units sold, driven by new product launches and festive shopping.

December is the weakest month, with just over 100 units sold, showing that Western-style holiday shopping has little impact in India.

Average prices stayed consistent, ranging from ₹56,000–₹65,000.

🗓️ Day-wise Trends

Midweek purchases dominate: Wednesday recorded the highest sales.

Mondays are the weakest, possibly due to fewer promotions or buying inertia at the start of the week.

🌍 Regional Trends

Sales are concentrated, with an “Unknown” category leading totals.

Among states, larger regions drive demand, while smaller territories contribute minimally (one sold just a single unit).

🛒 Platform Performance

Flipkart leads with over 4,200 units sold, far ahead of Amazon’s ~1,200.

Flipkart’s discounting and exclusive tie-ups appear to be the main driver.

📱 Model Popularity

The iPhone 15 (Blue, 128 GB) is the clear best-seller, with 1,300+ units sold.

Launch cycles directly influence demand, confirming Apple’s pull with new releases.

Conclusion

India’s iPhone market is launch-driven, promotion-sensitive, and platform-concentrated. Flipkart dominates sales, Wednesdays emerge as the strongest buying day, and the iPhone 15 leads as the most popular model. These insights highlight the importance of timing and partnerships in shaping Apple’s success in India.
